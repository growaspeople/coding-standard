GrowAsPeople JavaScript Coding Style Standard
==============================================

1. It is **necessary** to follow rules written in JSHint configuration file.
2. **Hopefully** follow rules written in JSCS configuration files, but it is **not mandatory**. (JSCS configuration has so strict rules. It is not good idea to care about such small issues too much.)
