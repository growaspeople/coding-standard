GrowAsPeople Coding Style Standards
====================================

This repository includes coding style standard documents and configuration files used in GrowAsPeople projects.

When you want to add rules, try not to add it into documents but  configuration files as possible.
Software engineers' primary common language is not English but programming languages. It is much easier to understand concretely rather than explaining in ambiguous natural language.
